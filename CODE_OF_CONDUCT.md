# Code of conduct

Because programmers can be annoying sometimes!

Dimitris Gravanis - <dimgrav@gmail.com>

## Motto

Have fun coding, or don't code at all!

## DOs & DON'Ts

The DOs:

* Play nice
* Share quality jokes (or jokes about code quality!)
* Help in any way you can
* Respect data privacy and freedom of choice

The DON'Ts:

* Don't be a know-it-all
* Don't be overly sensitive and triggered at a snowflake level
* This is a no-fly zone for bigots
* Actual harassment will not be tolerated

## Maintainer duties

Project maintainers must see to everyone contributing in the spirit of the DOs list.

Project maintainers can remove any contributions that are incompatible with this Code of Conduct, or to use the BanHammer&trade; on anyone who causes trouble to the community.

## Scope

The project repository and digital or actual interaction between contributors, related to the project in any way.

## Smite!

Any DON'Ts violation should be reported by contacting the repository administrator or any other maintenance team member.

In case the person reported was indeed out of bounds, they're not welcome to contribute anymore, at any level.

Say goodbye to that awesome pull request of yours.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is currently in version 0.1a.
